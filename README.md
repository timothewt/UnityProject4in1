This project which consists of four different games in one was the end of our Unity class and recaps everything we learned.

## Brick Breaker

You control the paddle with the left and right arrow keys of the keyboard.<br />
Every brick has three wear states, by hitting the brick you reduce it by one. They are indicated by the appearance of the brick (gold->stone->cracked stone). The goal is to destroy all the bricks with the ball. There is a little easter egg when you go to the next level.

## Furapi Bird

You control the bird with the up arrow key of the keyboard. Each time you press it the bird goes up a little.<br />
The goal is to go between the pipes as long as possible. Some of the pipes are moving up and down to add some difficulty. The background moves with a paralax effect to add some movement to the game.

## Apple Catcher

You control the player with the left and right keys of the keyboard.<br />
There are two game modes, one with 3 lives, in which each time you fail an apple or receive a bomb you lose on, and one with 2 minutes of game, in which you lose points if you let an apple fall under the screen or receive a bomb. 

## 8 Pool

This one was not asked for the project but we wanted to add our own game in it. You can access it by pressing [B] on the main menu. The controls and rules are more complex than the other game.<br />
You aim the cue with the mouse, when you want to shoot press the left click and hold it. You control the force by going more or less far from the ball. To shoot, release the click. The cancel the shot press right click.<br />
The goal is to score every ball of your color and after that score the 8-ball, which is the black one. The colors are determined by the first ball that one player scores.
If you score one of your balls without a fault, you play again.<br />
There is a fault when the first ball hit is not your own color. If you touch the black ball first and you still have other balls to score, it's also a fault. 
If you score the 8-ball while you still have other balls to score, you lost the game.

## How to play ?
You can play our game by downloading the executable file <a href="https://github.com/timothewt/UnityProject4in1/blob/main/Build/UnityProject4in1.exe">UnityProject4in1.exe</a>.

In each game you can press [P] to pause, [Esc] to go back to the main menu, and the space bar when the game is over to restart the same game.
